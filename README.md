# AlphaMatrix
A PyGame inspired by the Matrix

- The goal of the game is to avoid falling symbols:
- The player starts in the middle of the screen.
- The obstacles enter randomly from the top and move down in a straight line.
- The player can move left, right, up, or down by using the 'A', 'D', 'W' and 'S' keys respectively to avoid the obstacles.
- The player can also teleport using the arrow keys.
- The player can slow down time by holding the 'L_SHIFT' key
- The game ends either when the player is hit by an obstacle or when the user closes the window.

Here are some things that wonâ€™t be covered:

- No multiple lives
- No scorekeeping
- No music
